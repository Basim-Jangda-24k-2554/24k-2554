Q Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

1. START
2. Ask the user to enter the n Number 
3. Ask the user to enter the Nth number that is to be checked for bieng a divisor 
4. Set the n Number as 'A' 
5. Apply A/Nth number = C
6. IF C is an integer THEN  
              C = X 
    Else 
          Print ' the given Nth number is not a divisor to the n Number'
7. do A/2 = D 
8. IF D is an integer THEN
                Print 'the given n Number is an even number'
    Else 
         Print 'the given n Number is an odd number'
END
